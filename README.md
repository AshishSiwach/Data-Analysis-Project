## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 

## *Key Findings*

-- Mumbai has the highest RevPar(8,897) and highest ADR(15,385) among all cities while Delhi has the highest occupancy rate at 60.44%.
    
-- The top 3 properties by occupancy % are Atliq Palace Delhi(66.25%), Atliq Blu Mumbai(66.19%) and Atliq Palace Mumbai(66.13%) while Atliq Exotica Mumbai with occupancy % of 66.09% and rating 4.32 has the highest average rating.

-- The bottom 3 properties by occupancy % are Atliq Grands Bangalore(44.33%), Atliq Seasons Mumbai(44.57%) and Atliq Exotica Hyderabad(44.57%) and Atliq Seasons Mumbai has the lowest rating of 2.30.

-- Consequently the properties which have high occupancy % are among the ones with highest ratings and those with low occupancy % are among the ones with lowest average ratings which is quite suggestive of the correlation between occupancy % and average rating.

-- KPIs such as RevPar, ADR and Occupancy % are almost stable across weekends and weekdays which depicts that dynamic pricing strategy has not been practiced by the Atliq Grands management.

-- Highest ADR is coming from direct offline platform while lowest ADR is direct online platform which suggests that hotels are giving some discount coupons and concessions while booking directly from their websites, hotels can cash in on this opportunity even more by offering some more discounts which could drastically increase occupancy %.

-- There is a consistent decline in RevPar and Occupancy % after the week of July, although the cancellation rate is still approximately at the same levels as previous months, so not suggestive of any major problem and  thus could be attributed to the end of summer holidays in India.
